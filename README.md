## Usage

**Send Simple Notification**

notification = Notify()
notification.title = "Cool Title"
notification.message = "Even cooler message."
notification.send()
```

**Send Notification With Icon**

```python

from notifypy import Notify

notification = Notify()
notification.title = "Cool Title"
notification.message = "Even cooler message."
notification.icon = "path/to/icon.png"

notification.send()
```

**Send Notification With Sound**

```python

from notifypy import Notify

notification = Notify()
notification.title = "Cool Title"
notification.message = "Even cooler message."
notification.audio = "path/to/audio/file.wav"

notification.send()

```

**Sending Notifications without blocking**

```python

from notifypy import Notify

notification = Notify()
notification.send(block=False)

```

**Sending with Default Notification Titles/Messages/Icons**

```python

from notifypy import Notify

notification = Notify(
  default_notification_title="Function Message",
  default_application_name="Great Application",
  default_notification_icon="path/to/icon.png",
  default_notification_audio="path/to/sound.wav"
)

def your_function():
  # stuff happening here.
  notification.message = "Function Result"
  notification.send()
```

---

# CLI
A CLI is available when you install notify-py

```bash
notifypy --title --message --applicationName --iconPath --soundPath
```
You may need to add ``python3 -m`` to the beginning.

## Important Caveats

- As it stands (May 18, 2020), this is simply a notification service. There is _no_ support for embedding custom actions (buttons, dialogs) regardless of platform. Other then telling you if the shell command was sent, there is also no confirmation on user action on the notification.

- macOS does **not** support custom icons on the fly.. You will need to bundle a customized version of the notifier embedded with your custom icon.

---

### Windows Specific.

- No support for balloon tips (pre Win10).. This will be changed in the future.
